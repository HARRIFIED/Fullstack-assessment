# Technical Design Document: User Account Management System

## 1. System Overview

This system will provide a Node.js API for managing user accounts and financial transactions. It will allow users to create accounts, fund them, transfer money between accounts, and withdraw funds.

## 2. Architecture

The system will use a RESTful API architecture with the following components:

- Node.js with Express.js for the API server
- MongoDB as the database
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Flutterwave API for account funding

## 3. Database Schema

We'll use the following collections in MongoDB:

### Users Collection
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String,
  balance: Number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Transactions Collection
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  type: String, // 'fund', 'transfer', 'withdraw'
  amount: Number,
  recipientId: ObjectId, // only for transfers
  status: String, // 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## 4. API Endpoints

1. User Management:
    - POST /api/users/register - Create a new user account
    - POST /api/users/login - Log in and receive an auth token

2. Account Operations:
    - POST /api/account/fund - Fund user account (integrate with Flutterwave)
    - POST /api/account/transfer - Transfer funds to another user
    - POST /api/account/withdraw - Withdraw funds from account
    - GET /api/account/balance - Get current account balance

## 5. Authentication

We'll implement a simple token-based authentication system:

1. When a user logs in, generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) containing the user's ID.
2. Include this token in the Authorization header for authenticated requests.
3. Implement middleware to verify the token and attach the user to the request object.

## 6. Error Handling

Implement a centralized error handling middleware to catch and format errors consistently across the API.

## 7. Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests: Test individual functions and methods.
2. Integration Tests: Test API endpoints and database operations.
3. Mock external services (e.g., Flutterwave API) for consistent testing.

## 8. Security Considerations

1. Use HTTPS for all communications.
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
4. Use bcrypt for password hashing.
5. Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.

## 9. Scalability Considerations

1. Use connection pooling for database connections.
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., user balances).
3. Consider implementing a queue system for processing transactions asynchronously.
